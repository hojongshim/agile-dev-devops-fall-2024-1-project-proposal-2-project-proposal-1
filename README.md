# Project Proposal

## Project Title
GolfCaddy

## **What and Why?**

* GolfCaddy is a golf club rental platform designed for golfers looking to rent clubs on the short-term. A set of golf clubs can often be difficult to find for amateur golfers, as it is not a cheap investment. This application will solve those problems by offering a quick and easy solution to make golf more accessible for all.

* This application addresses the lack of abundance for golf club rental services online. Although most club houses offer rental services, some golfers look for more variety in their rental choices. Others may even want to rent the clubs for over a day in case of a short-term trip. GolfCaddy is intended to solve those difficulties through its user-friendly interface.

* This problem is important because it makes golf more accessible on a digital level. Many people don't have the money to immediately purchase a set of golf clubs, and it is currently difficult to find online platforms that offer services like this. It could attract an untouched user-base, as the market is currently more focused on other niche areas such as swing monitoring platforms, golf partner matching systems, and field performance trackers. 

### **For Whom?**

* GolfCaddy is designed for everyday golfers who are looking for short term club rentals. It is a useful system for players that need specific accomodations in advance, such as particular cases like the need for left-handed clubs, various shaft lengths/weight, and the preference for different clubs.

### **How?**

* The end-user will have access to the following features on GolfCaddy:

    * **Rent a Club**: User will be able to search for short-term club rentals. Here, we can filter by full set, or any specific type of club (putter, wedges, irons, woods, etc).

    * **Loan a Club**: User will be able to register a club for loan. Must enter information and picture of the club, banking information, and pick-up location in order for it to be listed.

    * **Find Golf Partner**: Feature that matches user with nearby users for finding golf partners. It is possible to filter by handicap.

    * **Manage Handicap**: User will be able to enter their recent rounding scores, and manage their handicaps. The date here will be used for the 'Find Golf Partner' feature.

### **Scope**

* The system is scoped for a team of 3-5 programmers to complete within the semester. The project's key features include the club rental system, find golf partner, and handicap management system. The project is detailed enough to stretch over the rest of the semester, but not too expansive -- providing a realistic goal that our team members can achieve within this timeframe.
